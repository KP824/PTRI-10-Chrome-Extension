// const btn1 = document.getElementById('newTabBtn1');

// When user starts extension, have to select which offerings they want today
// checkboxes / buttons for each: jokes, koans, exercises
// set interval for occurrences
// submit button
// (non-user, in background) disable any not checked
// Option to reset / stop the extension (clear interval)
// Show start pop-up again, with checkboxes


/* Notes for Jokes
- show in extension pop-up
- programming, foodie, one-liners, self-deprecating
*/
// Create an array and insert 20 random jokes, iterate over array and display curr joke
// STRETCH GOAL: have joke var, call joke API, store returned joke in var, display var; sometime before next occurence, call API again for new joke

/* Notes for Koans
- define what koans are (storytime!)
- show in extension pop-up, be prepared to be enlightened!
*/

/* Notes for Health Reminders
- get up and stretch, yoga stretch with image / GIF of how to do it
- maybe open a new tab (warn user - if select for health reminders, will force open new tab)
*/

/* IF WE HAD MORE TIME... HOW WOULD WE IMPROVE EXTENSION?
- Maybe create tutorial with preselected joke/koan/ or exercise to demonstrate functionality
- therapy API integration
- koan/s stories more interactive
